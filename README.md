<h1 align="center">Sonique</h1>

**Sonique** is a solo-developed interactive piano visualization tool that transforms MIDI files into beautifully animated falling notes.
Designed for learners, performers, and music lovers, it offers a clean and responsive interface for playing, practicing, and simply enjoying music in real time.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Sonique is in early development and not yet feature-complete.

The first working version (MVP) is kinda ready:

* Real-time MIDI playback

## Why Sonique?

Most MIDI visualizers do have some kind of cost and may also be a bit overcomplicated for some people

**Sonique** is free, will always be free. It is also open-source.
