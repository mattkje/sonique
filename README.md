**Sonique** is a solo-developed interactive piano visualization tool that transforms MIDI files into beautifully animated falling notes.
Designed for learners, performers, and music lovers, it offers a clean and responsive interface for playing, practicing, and simply enjoying music in real time.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Sonique is in early development and not yet feature-complete.

## 🚧 Project Status

**Current Phase:** MVP Complete – Iterating

The first working version (MVP) is ready! It includes:

* Real-time MIDI playback
* Smooth falling note animations
* A clean and functional user interface

I'm currently focused on improving stability, adding quality-of-life features, and expanding customization options.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

* **C++** – Core programming language
* **Raylib** – Lightweight rendering and game loop library
* **RtMidi** – Cross-platform MIDI I/O
* **FluidSynth** – Software synthesizer for high-quality MIDI playback

---

## 🖥️ Platforms

Initial development is on **macOS**, which will be the first supported platform.
I also plan to support **Windows**, with potential **Linux** support depending on demand and time.

## 🎯 Why Sonique?

Most MIDI visualizers are:

* Expensive
* Closed-source
* Overcomplicated

**Sonique** aims to be a free, open-source alternative that's easy to use and accessible to everyone.
